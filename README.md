# 🚀 Ashraf Eddounassi | Systems Administrator Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. This project is an interactive web platform designed to showcase my skills as a **Systems Administrator**, my technical projects, and my IT experience.

## 🛠️ Project Features

The project has been developed focusing on a smooth and professional user experience (UX):

* **Modern Terminal Style**: An interface that reflects a SysAdmin's workspace, using monospaced fonts (Fira Code) and interactive elements.
* **Dual Mode (Light/Dark)**: Implementation of a binary theme switcher (`0/1`) that toggles the entire site's color palette.
* **Fully Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
* **Dynamic Parallax Effect**: An interactive dot background that reacts to mouse movement for visual depth.
* **Interactive Contact Section**: A form that simulates a Command Line Interface (CLI).
